# Data Processing

## Syllabus: 

### Course Overview
This course provides a general overview of data processing techniques using Python. All examples are provided in Python, therefore, there are two modules dedicated to the basics of Python programming. The main Python package that we focus on throughout this course is Pandas, however, the basic functionality of other relevant packages such as NumPy and Matplotlib are introduced as well. The course examples are implemented in Python 3.x and the assignments and quizzes ask students to write in Python 3.x as well. This course is not based on data from a specific field of science and the examples are mostly randomly generated. 

### Course Goals
This course gives students primary and general methodologies and hand-on experience to apply basic data processing techniques on real-world data.

### Course Objectives
At the end of this course students will be able to:

Have hand-on experiences to load the target dataset into python 
Identify the problems in the dataset and evaluate data quality
Clean and reconstruct the dataset based on the desired format
Properly visualize different aspects and characteristics of data
